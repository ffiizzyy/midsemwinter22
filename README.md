Welcome to our data science project! We aim to make booking Airbnb's in Melbourne, Australia easier for you - especially as residents of a foreign country.

We will help you find which areas to pick and which AirBnb's to book.

You can also view our finished project on: https://ffiizzyy-midsemwinter22-finalproject-yltzf5.streamlit.app

If the link takes too long to load, please run the project in your terminal by using: streamlit run finalproject.py

Additional commits were made on Feb 8 to fix issues regarding Streamlit deployment due to Streamlit-specific dependency problems on the Textblob and NLTK packages, and issues uploading files with Git Large File Storage - it worked perfectly locally.

We hope you enjoy using the app and see value in what we have created!

Feliza and Polina :)
